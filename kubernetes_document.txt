What is kubernetes
==================
Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Wikipedia

why we use kubernets
====================


    Kubernetes is developed by Google whereas Docker Swarm is developed by Docker Inc.
    Kubernetes provides Auto-scaling whereas Docker Swarm doesnâ€™t support autoscaling.
    Kubernetes supports up to 5000 nodes whereas Docker Swarm supports more than 2000 nodes.
    Kubernetes is less extensive and customizable whereas Docker Swarm is more comprehensive and highly customizable.
    Kubernetes provides low fault tolerance while Docker provides high fault tolerance.

Key feature of kubernets
========================

    Offers automated scheduling
    Self-Healing capabilities
    Automated rollouts & rollback
    Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing
    Provides a higher density of resource utilization
    Offers enterprise-ready features
    Application-centric management
    Auto-scalable infrastructure
    You can create predictable infrastructure
    Provides declarative configuration
    Deploy and update software at scale
    Offers environment consistency for development, testing, and production 


Key feature of coe (Kubernets orchestration engine)
===================================================

1. clustering

2. scheduling

3. scaling

4. load balancing

5. fault tolarance

6. app deployment

Kubernetes introduction
=======================

who need kubernets
------------------

1. developers

2. system admins

3. managers


Course Objectives
------------------
1. kubernetes- overview

2. containers - Docker

3. container orchestration	

4. Demo - setup kubernets

5. kubernets - concepts - pods |replicasets| Deployment | services

6. Networking in kubernets

7. Kubernets Management - kubctl

8. Kubernets Defintion files - YAML

9. Kubernets on cloud - aws/Gcp



container orchestration
=======================

container orchestration based on load it's scale up and down the container. Automatically deploying and managing container it's called container orchestration

Kubernets container orchestration technology

multiple technology available

1. Docker swarm from docker

2. kubernets from google

3. messos from apache 


when load increases kubernetes launch new instances 

when we run out of hardware scale up the number of nodes without down the application

kubernets Architecture
======================

1. Nodes

Nodes is a machine physical or virtual,  nodes is a worker machine thats why container launch by kubernets 

it's also called minions in the past 

2. cluster

cluster is set of nodes group together, if one node fail your application still accessible by another node 

3. Master 

Master responsible for managing cluster,  information of the cluster members stored in the master 

master is a another kubernets installed in it 


kubernets components
====================

1. api server
 
2. etcd service 

3. scheduler

4. controller

5. container runtime

6. kubctl (kublex service)




1. Api server 
access frontend of kubernets,  users, management devices, command line interfaces, all talk to api server to interact with kubernets

2. etcd 

distributed  reliable key value store used by kubernets to manage the cluster 

when you have multible nodes multible master etcd stored all nodes and cluster information in distributed manner

etcd responsible for implementing logs with in cluster ensure no conflix between master 

3. scheduler

scheduler responsible for distributing works across multible nodes it looks newly created container and assign them into nodes

4. controller 

controlled brain behind archestration noticing and responsible when nodes container or endpoints goes down 

controller make decision to bring up new container in such a cases

5. container runtime 

container runtime underline software in our case it's happened to be docker


6. kublet 

kublet is agent that run each node on the clutser, kublet make sure container running on nodes as expected 


master vs worker
===============

so far we see two types of server master and worker 

how does one serer as master another one as a slave 

worker node aslo known as minions as container hosted to run docker container need to runtime install 	

workernode -- cri-o

container runtime -- rkt


kube api server thats what makes master


worker node have kublet agent to interact with master

all the information and key value stored in the master -- etcd

master also has controll manager and scheduler 



kubctl kube command line tool 

kube controll tool used to deploy and manage on a kubernets cluster 

get cluster information get status of other node 

# kubctl run hello-minikube

kubctl run command used to deploy application


kubctl cluster-info

view information about cluster 

kubctl get nodes

list the nodes of kubernets cluster

kubernets setup
===============


we can setup kubernets local machine or virtual machine using minikube microk8s kubeadm   


kubeadm tool manage used to bootstrap production grade in the kubernets


cloud enviroment
================

Google cloud (Gcp)

Aws 

Microsoft azure



Devops websites
===============

Minikube
========

This is easiest way to start kubernets on your local system


Master 
------

1. kube-apiserver

2. etcd

3. node-controller

4. replica controller


Worker node
-----------

1. kublet

2. container runtime



Minikube all of diffrent components into single image they configure singlenode kubernets cluster, we can get started in a matter of minutes

package into iso image available on online minikube provide executable commandline utility automatically download iso

you must install hybervisor on your system

finally you kubectl command line tool to interact with kubernets


you need three thing to run cluster 


1. hypervisor

2. kubctl

3. minikube

Minikube
========

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day


Minikube is an open source tool that enables you to run Kubernetes on your laptop or other local machine. It can work with Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. It runs a single-node cluster inside a virtual machine on your local machine


what is pod 
==========
Pods. Unlike other systems you may have used in the past, Kubernetes doesn't run containers directly; instead it wraps one or more containers into a higher-level structure called a pod. Any containers in the same pod will share the same resources and local network. ... Pods are used as the unit of replication in Kubernetes


A Pod is the basic execution unit of a Kubernetes application--the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. A Pod represents processes running on your cluster. ... Pods in a Kubernetes cluster can be used in two main ways: Pods that run a single container.


A cluster consists of one master machine and multiple worker machines or nodes. The master coordinates between all the nodes. A pod is the smallest unit of a cluster. It represents a running process on a cluster.
